### **Halving Mechanism**

Each day, a set number of MAGO will be unlocked to earn. The daily release of MAGO follows Binance block height, on the first day of the 6th month, the Daily MAGO unlocked is eaxctly halved compared to the 1st day of MAGO been available to earn.

### **Bitcoin Mechanism**

User's MAGO earnings are prorated, in the same way as the Difficulty Bomb in the Bitcoin and Ethereum designs, but settled instantly. In a given time period, more users and less MAGO (for every user), while fewer users and more MAGO for every user (for every user).

### **Einstein Mechanism**

"God tirelessly plays dice under laws which he has himself prescribed"

The system constantly keeps changing the amount of users' MAGO earnings by adding randomness which makes it unpredictable. To avoid any extrapolation of the amount of earnings, MAGO settlements happen every few minutes.

### **Hierarchical Mechanism**

The amount of rewards, that mean the amount of MAGO a user mine, increases with the higher pet level and pet number. It will be announced later.

### **Community Governance**

This part will be announced in the next few month
