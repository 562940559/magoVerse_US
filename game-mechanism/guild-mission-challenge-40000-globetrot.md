# Guild Mission Challenge（40000 Globetrot）

{% hint style="info" %}
SOLO Quest Mode and Guild Mission Mode have the same and shared movement data. Users can create their own guild and invite their friends to complete the 40,000 km challenge.

As a reward for that challenge, the guild will receive a luck bonus and the guild leader will receive an additional service bonus for supervising guild members to complete the daily quest which helps to build a healthy lifestyle.
